# Sorting-Algorithm-Visualzier-Using-PYTHON-Tkinter-Numpy-and-matplotlib-
This is our project for the course DAA.
Our main motive was to design a sorting algorithm visualizer.
The language that we were  used is "Python".In order to provide a good user Interaction We've created a GUI using Tkinter tool.
All the visualizing graphs are plotted on matplotlib.
